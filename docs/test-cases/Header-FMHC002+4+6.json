A directory might also manage information regarding a given provider's work assignment/allocation, expectations, and/or history (e.g., the percentage of time planned towards (or devoted to) patient care, research, teaching, administration, and/or other duties). Directory Information could also describe the type of care offered by a given care provider (e.g, cardiologist or general practitioner), health care setting (e.g., long term care facility or hospital), and categories of patient (e.g., children or geriatric patients)."
