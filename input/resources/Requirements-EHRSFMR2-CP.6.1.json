  "description": "Present providers with the list of medications that are to be administered to a patient, necessary administration information, and capture administration details.",
  "purpose": "In a setting in which medication orders are to be administered by a provider rather than the patient, the necessary information is presented including: the list of medication orders that are to be administered; administration instructions, times or other conditions of administration; dose and route, etc. The system shall securely relate medications to be administered to the unique identity of the patient (see [CPS.1.1](Requirements-EHRSFMR2-CPS.1.1.html)). Additionally, the provider can record what actually was or was not administered, whether or not these facts conform to the order. Appropriate time stamps for all medication related activity are generated.\n\nFor some settings that administer complete sets of medications from a variety of providers' orders, it may be useful to provide an additional check for possible drug-drug or other interactions.\n\nThe EHR system shall support the five “rights” - Right Patient, Right Drug, Right Dose, Right Route, Right Time.\n\nThe system should report medication administration, where appropriate, to public health or disease management authorities (e.g., oncology related medication orders should be communicated or transmitted to a cancer registry).",
