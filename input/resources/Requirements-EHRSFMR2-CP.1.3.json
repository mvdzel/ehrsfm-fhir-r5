The entire medication history for any medication including, over-the-counter products, alternative supplements and herbal medications, is viewable. Medication lists are not limited to provider orders/prescriptions but may also include, for example, pharmacy dispensed medications without prescription, over the counter medications and patient-reported medications, etc. All pertinent dates, including medication start, modification, and end dates are stored. Medication Lists may also include additional information such as age-specific dosage.",
