  "purpose": "Workflow management functions that an EHR-S supports include:\n- Distribution of information to and from internal and external parties;\n- Support for task-management as well as parallel and serial task distribution;\n- Support for notification and task routing based on system triggers; and\n- Support for task assignments, escalations and redirection in accordance with business rules.\n\nWorkflow definitions and management may be implemented by a designated application or distributed across an EHR-S.",
