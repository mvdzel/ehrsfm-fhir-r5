  "description": "Support remote health care services such as tele-health and remote device monitoring by integrating records and data collected by these means into the patient's record for care management, billing and public health reporting purposes.",
  "purpose": "Enables remote treatment of patients using monitoring devices, and two way communications between provider and patient or provider and provider. Promotes patient empowerment, self-determination and ability to maintain health status in the community. Promotes personal health, wellness and preventative care.
