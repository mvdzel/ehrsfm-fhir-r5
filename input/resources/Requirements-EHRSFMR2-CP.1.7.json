  "purpose": "Details of medical equipment, orthotic/prosthetic, and/or devices are captured as discrete data elements including information such as device type, date issued, date implanted or manufactured, device model number, device serial/lot number, manufacturer, supplier, involved extremity, anatomical location, date of battery change, and other data elements which many be required to correctly identify and track the equipment/device. The list may link to external sources, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), so that the provider may be alerted if the medical device is recalled. The entire equipment, prosthetic, orthotic, and/or implantable device list is able to be rendered.",
