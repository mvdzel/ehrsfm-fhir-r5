  "status": "active",
  "description": "Enable the use of registry services and directories to uniquely identify, locate and supply links for retrieval of information related to:\n- patients and providers for healthcare purposes;\n- payers, health plans, sponsors, and employers for administrative and financial purposes;\n- public health agencies for healthcare purposes, and- healthcare resources and devices for resource management purposes.",
  "purpose": "Registry and directory service functions are critical to successfully managing the security, interoperability, and the consistency of the health record data across an EHR-S. These services enable the linking of relevant information across multiple information sources within, or external to, an EHR-S for use within an application. This applies to directories/registries internal to the EHR-S as well as directories/registries external to the EHR-S. Transmission may occur automatically or manually and may include small or large amounts of data. Directories and registries support communication between EHR Systems and may be organized hierarchically or in a federated fashion. For example, a patient being treated by a primary care physician for a chronic condition may become ill while out of town. The new provider's EHR-S interrogates a local, regional, or national registry to find the patient's previous records. From the primary care record, a remote EHR-S retrieves relevant information in conformance with applicable patient privacy and confidentiality rules.\n\nAn example of local registry usage is an EHR-S application sending a query message to the Hospital Information System to retrieve a patient's demographic data.",
