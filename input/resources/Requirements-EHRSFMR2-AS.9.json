As a byproduct of care delivery and documentation captures and presents all patient information needed to support coding. Ideally performs coding based on documentation.\n\nClinically automated revenue cycle - examples of reduced denials and error rates in claims.\n\nClinical information needed for billing is available on the date of service.\n\nPhysician and clinical teams do not perform additional data entry / tasks exclusively to support administrative or financial processes."
