  "title": "AS.9.2 Support Financial Eligibility Verification (Function)",
  "status": "active",
  "description": "Support interactions with other systems, applications, and modules to enable eligibility verification for health insurance and special programs, including verification of benefits and pre-determination of coverage.",
  "purpose": "Retrieves information needed to support verification of coverage at the appropriate juncture in the encounter workflow. Improves patient access to covered care and reduces claim denials. When eligibility is verified, the system could prompt a provider to capture eligibility information needed for processing administrative and financial documentation, reports or transactions; updating or flagging any inconsistent data. In addition to health insurance eligibility, this function would support verification of registration in programs and registries, such as chronic care case management and immunization registries. A system would likely verify health insurance eligibility prior to the encounter, but would verify registration in case management or immunization registries during the encounter.\n\nExample(s):\nA US Realm example could include information about capturing VFC eligibility status as this is a requirement for any provider using federally funded vaccine in the USA.",
