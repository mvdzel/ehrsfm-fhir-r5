  "status": "active",
  "description": "Create prescriptions or other medication orders with detail adequate for correct filling and administration. Provide information regarding compliance of medication orders with formularies. Provide drug utilization review functionality including alerts regarding drug interactions and allergies.",
  "purpose": "Medications include prescribed and over the counter (OTC) drugs, allergy shots, oxygen, anesthetics, chemotherapy, and dietary supplements that were ordered, supplied, administered, or continued. Different medication orders, including new, discontinue, refill/continue, and renew require different levels and kinds of detail, as do medication orders placed in different situations. Administration or patient instructions are available for selection by the ordering clinician, or the ordering clinician is facilitated in creating such instructions. The system may allow for the creation of common content for prescription details. Appropriate time stamps for all medication related activity are generated. This includes series of orders that are part of a therapeutic regimen, e.g., Renal Dialysis, Oncology. When it comes to capturing the medication rationale, it is not mandatory that the provider always provide this information. \n\nIn addition, the system should present the clinician with clinical decision support functionality (such as the presentation of allergies, drug-drug interactions) during the medication ordering process. When a clinician places an order for a medication, that order may or may not comply with a formulary specific to the patient's location or insurance coverage, if applicable. Whether the order complies with the formulary should be communicated to the ordering clinician at an appropriate point to allow the ordering clinician to decide whether to continue with the order. Formulary-compliant alternatives to the medication being ordered may also be presented.",
