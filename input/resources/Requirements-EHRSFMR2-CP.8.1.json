  "purpose": "When a patient is scheduled for a test, procedure, or discharge, specific instructions about diet, clothing, transportation assistance, convalescence, follow-up with physician, etc., may be generated and recorded, including the timing relative to the scheduled event. In an outpatient scenario, similar instructions for post-diagnosis, and/or post-treatment needs may also be generated and recorded (e.g., exercise instructions for low back pain, wound or burn care).",
