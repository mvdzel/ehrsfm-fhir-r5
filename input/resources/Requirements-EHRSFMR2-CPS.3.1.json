  "status": "active",
  "description": "Support the establishment, updates and use of assessment forms that will assist in the development of and adherence to care plans, guidelines, and protocols at the point of information capture.",
  "purpose": "As part of managing assessment definitions, the system will support the ability to create a set of assessment forms and, optionally, associated logic (e.g., workflow, business and clinical rules). This assessment definition process may include the ability to define, revise and manage the tools, files and processing for the conduct of a patient assessment. Furthermore, the assessment definition may also include template development, prompts for additional information, related notification alerts and workflow processes. When a clinician fills out an assessment, data entered triggers the system to prompt the assessor to consider issues that would help assure a complete/accurate assessment. A simple demographic value or presenting problem (or combination) could provide a template for data gathering that represents best practice in this situation, e.g., Type 2 (Adult Onset) Diabetes diabetic review, fall and 70+, and rectal bleeding. Support for standard assessment may include the ability to record and store the value for the answers to specific questions in standardized assessment tools or questionnaires. When a specific recognized-standard assessment does not exist, the system will support the creation of unique new, locally-defined assessment. The system may enable, and/or encourage the use of the format and data elements of similar assessments in the systems whenever possible. NOTE: A new assessment may not necessarily be unique, since a facility may copy an assessment from another facility.",
