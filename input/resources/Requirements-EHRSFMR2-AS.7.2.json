  "description": "Provide assistance in assembling data, supporting data collection and processing output from a specific encounter.",
  "purpose": "Workflows, based on the encounter management settings, will assist (with triggers alerts and other means) in determining and supportingdata collection, import, export, extraction, linkages and transformation. As an example, a pediatrician is presented with diagnostic and procedure codes specific to pediatrics. Business rules enable automatic collection of data from the patient's health record and patient registry. As the provider enters data, workflow processes are triggered to populate transactions and documents. For example, data entry might populate an eligibility verification transaction or query the immunization registry.",
