  "title": "AS.5.1 Clinical Task Creation, Assignment and Routing (Function)",
  "status": "active",
  "description": "Creation, assignment, delegation, and/or transmission of tasks to the appropriate parties.",
  "purpose": "A \"Task\" is a specific piece of work or duty that is assigned to a person or entity. A task often needs to be accomplished within a defined period of time or by a deadline. Tasks are often managed by an activity (or project) tracking mechanism (e.g., as part of an automated business rule process). Tasks are determined by the specific needs of patients and practitioners in a care setting. Task creation may be automated, where appropriate. An example of a system-triggered task is when laboratory results are received electronically; a task to review the result is automatically generated and assigned to a responsible party. Tasks are at all times assigned to at least one user or role for disposition. Whether the task is assignable and to whom the task can be assigned will be determined by the specific needs of practitioners in a care setting. \n\nTask-assignment lists help users prioritize and complete assigned tasks. For example, after receiving communication (e.g., a phone call or e-mail) from a patient, the triage nurse routes or assigns a task to return the patient's call to the physician who is on call physician. Another example is for a urinalysis, the nurse routes or assigns a task to clinical staff to collect a urine specimen, and for the results to be routed to the responsible physician and person ordering the test. Task creation and assignment may be automated, where appropriate. An example is when (International Normalized Ratio) INR results are received they should be automatically routed and assigned to the staff person in the clinic responsible for managing all of the patients that are having INR tests done. Task assignment ensures that all tasks are disposed of by the appropriate person or role and allows efficient interaction of entities in the care process. When a task is assigned to more than one individual or role, an indication is required to show whether the task must be completed by all individuals/roles or if only one completion suffice.",
