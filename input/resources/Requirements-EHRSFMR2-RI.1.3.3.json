  "description": "Manage successive Record Entry versions over time.",
  "purpose": "The system must have a mechanism to handle versions and succession of Record Entries (such as a preliminary and final laboratory reports, amended or corrected documents). Versioning and succession management is based on Record Entry content, and/or status change over time.\n\nA version may be one of:1) A completed and attested Record Entry; 2) A Record Entry completed and attested which has been modified one or more times3) A Record Entry that has been viewed for clinical decision-making purposes by an individual other than the author4) A Record Entry that has been captured in an incomplete state per organization business rules and updated over time (i.e., a preliminary laboratory test). 5) A Record Entry that electively, according to the author, must be preserved in the current state at a given point in time (i.e., History and Physical). Certain types of Record Entries are typically handled in versions, for example:\n        laboratory results (preliminary and final)- Dictated reports- Work ups (over course of days)The prior version of Record Entries should be retained for the legally prescribed timeframe as defined by scope of practice, organizational policy, and jurisdictional law.",
