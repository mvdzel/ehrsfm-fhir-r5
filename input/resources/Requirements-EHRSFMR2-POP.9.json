  "title": "POP.9 Support Consistent Healthcare Management of Patient Groups or Populations (Function)",
  "status": "active",
  "description": "Provide the ability to identify and consistently manage healthcare over time and across populations or groups of patients that share diagnoses, problems, functional limitations, treatment, medications, and demographic characteristics that may impact care ( e.g., population management, disease management, wellness management or care management).",
  "purpose": "Populations or groups of patients that share diagnoses (such as diabetes or hypertension), problems, functional limitations, treatment, medication, and demographic characteristics such as race, ethnicity, religion, socio-economic status that may impact care are identified for the clinician. The clinician is advised and assisted with management of these patients to optimize the clinician's ability to provide appropriate care. For example, a clinician is alerted to information regarding racial, cultural, religious, socio-economic, living situation and functional limitations of the patient that are required to provide appropriate care. Among other examples are notification of the patients' eligibility for a particular test, therapy, or follow-up; availability of supportive resources in the community; or results from audits of compliance of these populations with disease management protocols. The system may also Include the ability to identify groups of patients based on clinical observations or laboratory test results and assist in initiating a follow-up or recall for selected patients.\n\nThe system may also provide the ability to create and render configurable reports for specific populations/or topics of interest, e.g. chronic conditions, suicidal risk, or post traumatic stress syndrome, or traumatic brain injury.",
