  "status": "active",
  "description": "Where not covered above, provide the means to manage and organize the documentation of the health care needed and delivered during an encounter/episode of care.",
  "purpose": "Using data standards and technologies that support interoperability, effective documentation of an encounter can promote patient- centered/oriented care and enables real-time, immediate point-of-service care delivery. Effective encounter and episode-of-care documentation can facilitate efficient work flow and improve operations performance. This can help to ensure the integrity of \n- the health record, \n- public health, financial and administrative reporting, and \n- the healthcare delivery process.",
