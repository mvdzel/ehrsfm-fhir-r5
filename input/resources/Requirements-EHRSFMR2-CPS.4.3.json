  "description": "Facilitate provider review and validation of order information to make it pertinent, effective and resource-conservative at the point of order entry.",
  "purpose": "The system assists provider during order entry for therapies, treatments, care, diagnostics and medical supplies and equipment. Support includes, for example: alerts to duplicate orders, missing results or other information required to initiate order, suggested corollary orders, order sets, best practice guidelines, institution-specific order guidelines and patient diagnosis specific recommendations. Also alerts for orders that may be inappropriate or contraindicated for specific patients, for example, X-rays on pregnant women.",
