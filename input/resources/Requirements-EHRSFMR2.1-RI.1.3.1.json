  "description": "Manage Record Entries during the various states of completion.",
  "purpose": "Record Entries may reside in various states that must be managed. An important underlying principle for managing record states is the need to retain Record Entries that have been viewed for patient care purposes even if it has not been completed or attested. This principle has important legal impact because it provides a record of what the provider relied on for clinical decision-making. For example, if a Record Entry was available in pending state and a clinician accessed the information to make decisions, it is important to retain the pending version even after the final version was available. Determining if the Record Entry was accessed for patient care may be challenging. Access logs should show if the information was accessed/viewed.",
