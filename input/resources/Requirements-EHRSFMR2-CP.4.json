  "status": "active",
  "description": "Provide the ability to manage clinical orders and results including medication, non-medication, diagnostic tests, blood products, other biologics and referrals, using order sets as appropriate.",
  "purpose": "The provision of clinical care includes the need to order from a variety of treatments using order sets as appropriate as well as reviewing the results of treatment. Orders for treatments may include medications, non-medication therapies (e.g., physical therapy, special diet, immunizations, non-allopathic regimens); diagnostic care (e.g., laboratory , radiology); blood products and other biologics (e.g., blood transfusions, human growth hormones). Patients are often referred to other health care providers for more specialized diagnostic workup, and/or treatment. An effective EHR-S must include support and management of these processes and associated documentation.",
