  "title": "CPS.4.2.1 Support for Medication Interaction and Allergy Checking (Function)",
  "status": "active",
  "description": "Identify medication interaction warnings at the time of medication or immunization ordering, or prescribing, as well as at the time of dispensing.",
  "purpose": "The clinician is alerted to medication-medication, medication-allergy, medication-food, medication-supplement (herbal or dietary) interactions at levels appropriate to the health care setting and with respect to the patient condition. These alerts may be customized to suit the user or group.\n\nNote, medication may be affected by food or dietary choices; whist this is not considered an interaction it is consequently not included in this function; however, the provision of drug-food effectiveness in information to be provided to the patient is included in the function [[CP.8.1]] (Generate, Record and Distribute Patient-Specific Instructions). If the patient's condition is one where, in order to view the necessary components of the health record, patient authorization or consent is required; then the system should show the medication but mask the condition for which the medication is prescribed until the required consent or authorization is available. In an emergent situation, where all health information is required to provide the most effective treatment, and it is not possible to obtain an authorization or consent; the system should provide an override (e.g., \"break the glass\") function to allow access to the diagnosis or problem for which a medication was ordered, according to scope of practice, organizational policies, and/or jurisdictional law.",
