  "description": "Manage patient demographic information.",
  "purpose": "Demographic information (including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, date of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity) must be managed to support unique patient identification, reporting, care provision requirements. Patient Demographic information may also include information about the patient's contacts, methods of contact (e.g., email or telephone), and modes of contact (e.g., call secretary during the day, send text message on the weekend). Patient demographic data are captured and maintained as discrete fields and may be enumerated, numeric, or codified according to scope of practice, organizational policy, and/or jurisdictional law. Key patient identifiers (i.e., name and primary patient record identifier) often appear on patient information output (e.g., rendering of a patient's record). Patients may have multiple, and/or compound names, sometimes employing accent marks or special characters. To help parse patient names, discete fields are often used.\nExample:\nFor example, \"Mary Jane Sue Smith\" may be parsed as: First-name: “Mary Jane\", Middle-name: ”Sue\", Last-name: “Smith\". Some jurisdictions may specify the capture and reporting of key patient demographic information (e.g., the \"Meaningful Use, Stage 2\" information requirements in the USA).",
