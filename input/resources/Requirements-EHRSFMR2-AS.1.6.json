  "purpose": "An organization might employ the concept of caseload or panel of patients to facilitate continuity of care and distribution of work. A caregiver may have, or be accountable for, one or more defined caseloads or panels of members/patient/clients within the organization. Information about a caseload or panel may include an indication that an opening is available on a certain caseload or an indication that a certain patient is not suitable for that caseload. A member/patient may be provided access to a listing of caregivers with open caseloads or panels to select a provider.\n\nExample(s):\nExamples of caseload or panel assignments:\n- A wound care nurse is assigned certain patients based upon their care needs. A list of those patients can be produced to assist the wound care nurse in delivering care.\n- A provider with an open caseload can be assigned additional patients.",
