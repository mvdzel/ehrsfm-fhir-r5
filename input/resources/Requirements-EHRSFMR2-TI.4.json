  "description": "Support semantic interoperability through the use of standard terminologies, standard terminology models and standard terminology services.",
  "purpose": "The purpose of supporting terminology standards and services is to enable semantic interoperability. Interoperability is demonstrated by the consistency of human and machine interpretation of shared data and reports. It includes the capture and support of consistent data for templates and decision support logic.\n\nTerminology standards pertain to concepts, representations, synonyms, relationships and computable (machine-readable) definitions. Terminology services provide a common way for managing and retrieving these items, including historically correct version interpretation. Terminology services need to support legal requirements for retrospective health record information and system data."
