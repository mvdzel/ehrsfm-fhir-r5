  "description": "Provide the ability to record and manage patient-specific privacy consent directive consistent with privacy policies.",
  "purpose": "The system enables the management of information access to support privacy policies. These policies allow patients to stipulate specific privacy preferences as a privacy consent directive. The consent may be issued for a specific disclosure, for a period of time, or until it is explicitly revoked. This function depends on infrastructure to enforce the privacy consent and any associated privacy policies using a combination of access control, secure messaging, secure data routing, and data segmentation.",
