There are now a total of 27 Record Lifecycle Events, describing how an Electronic Health Record System manages health record entries their lifespan, from first point of entry origination/retention to last point of entry deletion or destruction. The 27 Record Lifecycle Events match those specified in ISO 21089-2018, Health Informatics â€“ Trusted end-to-end information flow and HL7 Fast Health Interoperable Resources (FHIR) Record Lifecycle Event Implementation Guide, published a spart of FHIR Core STU-3 (March 2017) and now part of FHIR Core R4 (in ballot, September 2018).

    * The Conformance Clause is updated to include a definition/description of a new type of EHR-S FM Functional Profile (FP): Derived Companion FP.
