The EHR-S FM validation rules are automatically because of the FHIR Profiling itself or, where possible, defined as constraints in the base Requirements resource. As a result the FM validation report is now available as part of the [QA page](qa.html).

See the constraints in the following profiles:

* [Requirements-FunctionalModel](StructureDefinition-FunctionalModel.html#constraints)
* [Requirements-FMSection](StructureDefinition-FMSection.html#constraints)
* [Requirements-FMHeader](StructureDefinition-FMHeader.html#constraints)
* [Requirements-FMFunction](StructureDefinition-FMFunction.html#constraints)
