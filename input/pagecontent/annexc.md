### What is HL7?

Established in 1987, Health Level Seven (HL7) is an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredited,
not-for-profit standards-development organization, whose mission is to provide standards for the exchange,
integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information; support clinical practice; and support the
management, delivery and evaluation of health services. ANSI accreditation, coupled with HL7's own
procedures, dictates that any standard published by HL7 and submitted to ANSI for approval, be developed and
ratified by a process that adheres to ANSI's procedures for open consensus and meets a balance of interest
requirement by attaining near equal participation in the voting process by the various constituencies that are
materially affected by the standard (e.g., vendors, providers, government agencies, consultants, non-profit
organizations).
This balance of interest goal ensures that a particular constituency is neither refused
participation nor is it allowed to dominate the development and ratification of a proposed standard. More
information and background on ANSI is available on their website at: http://www.ANSI.org

### The HL7 Electronic Health Records Work Group

The HL7 Electronic Health Records Special Interest Group (EHR SIG) was established in the spring of 2002. In
the spring of 2003 the HL7 group began efforts to develop a standardized functional specification for Electronic
Health Records Systems (EHR-S). In May 2004 the SIG was promoted to a full HL7 Technical Committee,
becoming the EHR TC. The EHR TC is intended primarily to serve as a body which promotes the uptake of
Electronic Health Record (EHR) implementation by standardizing the functions that may be present, based on
user selection, in an EHR-S.

The Department of Health and Human Services, the Veterans Health Administration, the Health Information
Management Systems Society and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, in a public-private partnership,
approached HL7 to accelerate their existing work to develop a consensus standard to define the functions of an
EHR-S. HL7, through its EHR SIG, responded by developing an EHR-S Functional Model that passed ballot
as a Draft Standard for Trial Use (DSTU) in April 2004. The Functional Model DSTU was published and formally
registered with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in July 2004. The Functional Model was then
balloted and passed as a normative standard as part of the January 2007 HL7 Work Group Meeting and is now
registered as a normative standard with ANSI 
Learning important lessons from the ballot process, a Functional Model with a clearer, more simplified list of
functions, has been created. The HL7 EHR System Functional Model provides a reference list of functions that
may be present in an Electronic Health Record System (EHR-S). The Function List is described from a user
perspective with the intent to enable consistent expression of system functionality. This EHR-S Model, through
the creation of Functional Profiles, enables a standardized description and common understanding of functions
sought or available in a given setting (e.g. intensive care, cardiology, office practice in one country or primary
care in another country).
