Claiming Conformance to a Functional Profile

When a software vendor/developer wishes to claim (for their product) conformance to a version of an EHR
Functional Profile the document claiming conformance should include the following information:
* The Name and Version of the standard that the software product is conformant with
* A full listing of the functions and conformance criteria that the software product is conformant with

In this manner any individual/organization evaluating the software product may easily determine its claimed
functionality.

The documentation detailing the process of determining conformance using a tool (for example, the software
was tested using the widget tool for specific conformance criteria) shall include the name of the tool, the version
of the tool and the date(s) of testing.

The process of claiming conformance to one or more Functional Profiles shall not be construed as creating a
new Functional Profile.

Should an end user (provider) find that a particular EHR-S product is not in compliance with a conformance
criterion claimed in the software statement of conformance, the end user (provider) should first address the
issue with the software developer. The end user (provider) may also communicate their findings with the HL7
EHR Work Group. The EHR WG shall not be responsible for validation of any statement of conformance or for
intervening with a software vendor/developer when a discrepancy is reported by an end user but may at its
discretion reach out to the EHR-S vendor/developer to discuss the identified issues.
